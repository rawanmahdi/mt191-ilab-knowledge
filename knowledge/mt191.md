# SWIFT Financial Application (FIN) message structure

## Messages have the following structure:

{1: Basic Header Block} {2: Application Header Block} {3: User Header Block} {4: Text Block or body} {5: Trailer Block}

These five SWIFT message blocks include header information, the body of the message, and a trailer. All blocks have the same basic format: {n: ...}. The curly braces ({}) indicate the beginning and end of a block.

n is the block identifier, in this case a single integer between 1 and 5. Each block identifier is associated with a particular part of the message. There is no carriage return or line feed (CRLF) between blocks.

Blocks 3, 4, and 5 may contain sub-blocks or fields delimited by field tags. Block 3 is optional. Many applications, however, populate block 3 with a reference number so that when SWIFT returns the acknowledgement, it can be used for reconciliation purposes.


## {1: Basic Header Block}


The basic header block is fixed-length and continuous with no field delimiters. It has the following format:

{1:    F    01   CIBCCATTAXXX   2222   123456}
(a)   (b)  (c)        (d)                (e)            (f)
 

a)
1: = Block ID (always 1)


b)
Application ID as follows:
F = FIN (financial application) Note:  We will opt for this option while creating EnI MT messages
A = GPA (general purpose application)
L = GPA (for logins, and so on)


c)
Service ID as follows:
01 = FIN/GPA  Note:  We will opt for this option while creating EnI MT messages
21 = ACK/NAK


d)
CIBCCATTAXXX = Logical terminal (LT) address. It is fixed at 12 characters; 8 character BIC code with 9th character other than  X followed by branch code. This has the sender's BIC (this will have the BIC of the bank where we implement our solution) with additional 9th character as Non-X character.


e)
2222 = Session number. It is generated by the user's computer and is padded with zeros.


f)
123456 = Sequence number that is generated by the user's computer. It is padded with zeros.



## {2: Application Header Block}
 

There are two types of application headers:

Input (Input to SWIFT) and Output (Output from SWIFT). Both are fixed-length and continuous with no field delimiters.

Note: When EnI creates a message it will be sent to SWIFT, hence it is considered as Input message.

The input (to SWIFT) structure is as follows:

{2:    I     192    ICICINBBXXXX    N       2       020}
(a)   (b)    (c)      (d)                          (e)     (f)      (g)


a)
2: = Block ID (always 2)
 

b)
I = Input
 

c)
192 = Message type (E.g. 192, 195, 196 etc.)
 

d)
ICICINBBXXXX = Receiver's BIC with additional X in position 9 before 3 character branch code. It is padded with Xs if no branch code is available.
 

e)
U = the message priority as follows:
S = System
N = Normal  Note:  We will opt for this option while creating EnI MT messages
U = Urgent


f) Note: This is optional. And we will not use it.
3 = Delivery monitoring field is as follows:
1 = Non delivery warning (MT010)
2 = Delivery notification (MT011)
3 = Both valid = U1 or U3, N2 or N


g) Note: This is optional. And we will not use it.
003 = Obsolescence period. It specifies when a non-delivery notification is generated as follows:
Valid for U = 003 (15 minutes)
Valid for N = 020 (100 minutes)


The output (from SWIFT) structure is as follows: (Note: This is for incoming messages (From SWIFT to EnI application). Not applicable for the messages created and sent out to SWIFT by EnI application)


{2:   O      192   1200   240618BANKBEBBAXXX2222123456   240618  1201   N}
(a)   (b)    (c)       (d)                                   (e)                                             (f)          (g)     (h)


a)
2: = Block ID (always 2)


b)
O = Output


c)
192 = Message type


d)
1200 = Input time with respect to the sender. The hour (HH) and minute (MM) on which the sender sent the message to SWIFT.

Format: HHMM


e)
The Message Input Reference (MIR), including input date, with Sender's address

The MIR consists of four elements:
1. Sender's Date - Date when the Sender sent the message. Format : YYMMDD
2. The Logical Terminal (LT) Address is a 12-character FIN address. It is the address of the sending LT for this message and includes the Branch Code. It consists of:
- the Sender BIC 8 CODE (8 characters)
- the Logical Terminal Code (1 upper case alphabetic character)
- the Sender BIC Branch Code (3 characters).
It defines the sender of the message to the SWIFT network.
3. Session numberÂ 
4. Sequence number 


f)
240618 = Output date with respect to Receiver

Format: YYMMDD


g)
1201 = Output time with respect to Receiver

Format: HHMM


h)
N = Message priority as follows:
S = System
N = Normal
U = Urgent


## {3: User Header Block}


This is an optional block. We will use field 108 in this block while creating EnI messages (to match this message against the ACK/NAK received from SWIFT). The value in this sub-block will be copied from Field 20 of the message.

Example of block 3 may have following structure:

{3:{108:abcdefgh12345678}}
(a)                (b)                   


a)
3: = Block ID (always 3)


b)

108:abcdefgh12345678
This is the Message User Reference (MUR) used by applications for reconciliation. It can be up to 16 characters, and will be returned in the ACK/NAK


## {4: Text Block or body}
 

This block is where the actual message content is specified and is what most users see. Generally the other blocks are stripped off before presentation. The format, which is variable length and requires use of CRLF as a field delimiter, is as follows:

{4:CRLF
:20:2319176490237841
:21:494932/DEV
:11S:103
090527

-}

Note: This is an example of MT192.


## {5: Trailer Block}



This is an optional block. The trailer either indicates special circumstances that relate to message handling or contains security information.

A message always ends in a trailer with the following format:

{5: {MAC:12345678}{CHK:123456789ABC}

This block is for SWIFT system use and contains a number of fields that are denoted by keywords such as the following:

MAC
Message Authentication Code calculated based on the entire contents of the message using a key that has been exchanged with the destination and a secret algorithm. Found on message categories 1,2,4,5,7,8, most 6s and 304.


CHK
Checksum calculated for all message types.


PDE
Possible Duplicate Emission added if user thinks the same message was sent previously


DLM
Added by SWIFT if an urgent message (U) has not been delivered within 15 minutes, or a normal message (N) within 100 minutes.
